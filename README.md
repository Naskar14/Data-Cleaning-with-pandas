# Data-Cleaning-with-pandas - Call centre customer details data - 
I did complete step by step data cleaning using pandas. 
Exporting the raw data in a dataframe > then I dropped all the duplicate rows > Dropped not so useful columns > replaced all the special characters from various columns 
> Converted the values in a proper format > Converted columns's data types > Split to whole customer addresses in different columns (street address, State, Zip) >
Dropped all the rows where customers had updated 'Do not contact' as 'YES' and dropped all rows where phone numbers are not there > Lastly reset the index
